# COVID-19 Quarantine Guide

## Overview

While COVID-19 is spreading rapidly, it is important for members of vulnerable groups to avoid contracting the virus. This includes people over 60 years old and people with underlying medical conditions. 

The best way to avoid contracting COVID-19 is to stay inside your own home and avoiding in-person interactions with people from outside of your household, until the COVID-19 pandemic is under control. This document contains guidelines and techniques for self-quarantine in your own home.

## Why Quarantine

With the rapid spread of COVID-19, hospitals are facing two immediate shortages to treat patients: the available number of ICU beds, and the available number of mechanical ventilators. A large number of people who contract COVID-19 will require hospitalization, and the likelyhood you will need to go to the hospital increases with age.

If infected, current estimates indicate that 16.6% of people above 60, 24.3% of people above 70, and 27.3% of people above 80 will require hospitalization. Estimates also show that 30% of those hospitalized will need to be treated with oxygen using a ventilator.[^imperial] 

As hosptials continue to fill with COVID-19 patients, there is chance that there will not be an ICU bed or a ventilator for you if you get sick.
