# COVID-19 Quarantine Guide

## Overview

While COVID-19 is spreading rapidly, it is important for members of vulnerable groups to avoid contracting the virus. This includes people over 60 years old and people with underlying medical conditions. 

The best way to avoid contracting COVID-19 is to stay inside your own home and avoiding in-person interactions with people from outside of your household, until the COVID-19 pandemic is under control. This document contains guidelines and techniques for self-quarantine in your own home.

## Why Quarantine

With the rapid spread of COVID-19, hospitals are facing two immediate shortages to treat patients: the number of ICU beds avaialble, and the number of ventilators. A large number of people who contract COVID-19 will require hospitalization, and the chances you will need to go to the hospital increases with age.

If infected, current estimates indicate that 16.6% of people in their 60s, 24.3% of people in their 70s, and 27.3% of people above 80 will require hospitalization. Estimates also show that 30% of those who require hospitalization for COVID-19 will need to be treated with oxygen using a mechanical ventilator.
