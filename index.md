# COVID-19 Quarantine Guide

## Overview

While COVID-19 is spreading rapidly, it is important for members of vulnerable groups to avoid contracting the virus. This includes people over 60 years old and people with underlying medical conditions. 

Until the COVID-19 pandemic is under control, the best way to avoid contracting COVID-19 is to stay inside your own home and avoiding interacting with people from outside of your household. This document contains guidelines and techniques for self-quarantine in your own home.


## Why you need to stay at home

With the rapid spread of COVID-19, hospitals are facing two immediate shortages to treat patients: the available number of ICU beds, and the available number of mechanical ventilators. A large number of people who contract COVID-19 will require hospitalization, and the likelyhood you will need to go to the hospital increases with age.

If infected, current estimates indicate that 16.6% of people above 60, 24.3% of people above 70, and 27.3% of people above 80 will require hospitalization. Estimates also show that 30% of those hospitalized will need to be treated with oxygen using a ventilator.[^imperial] 

As hosptials continue to fill with COVID-19 patients, there is chance that there will not be an ICU bed or a ventilator for you if you get sick.

## Staying healthy

### Handwashing
Fortunately, regular soap and water is very effective at breaking down coronavirus.[^soapvideo] Washing your hands frequently is an important way to stay healthy, but you will need to wash your hands for at least twenty seconds, which might be longer than you are used to. Also, you will need to use a six-step handwashing technique to make sure you get all the parts: palms, backs, between fingers, thumbs, knuckles, and nails.

This video demonstrates proper handwashing technique:

After you have finished washing, make sure you completely dry your hands with a clean towel.

### Avoid touching your face
Coronavirus is very transmissible, and it is possible to contract the virus after touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.[^surface] Make sure to you wash your hands before eating and before preparing food, but also make sure to wash them anytime you touch a surface someone else might have touched or coughed on.

Avoid touching your face, especially if you are outside your house. Wearing gloves and a mask or scarf will help keep you from touching your face.

### Other hand hygiene
Frequent handwashing will leave your hands dry. At least once a day, use hand lotion to moisturize your hands so your skin does not crack and bleed. Also, be sure to keep your fingernails trimmed.

## Disinfecting

You will need to disinfect frequently-touched surfaces and anything that comes into your house, in order to keep yourself from being infected. Disinfecting deliveries and groceries is quite time-consuming, but easier when you get the hang of it.

### Disinfectants to use

The EPA provides a [list of disinfectants to use](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2) against the SARS-Cov-2 virus.[^epa] The CDC provides a [detailed guide](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html) on how to disinfect surfaces.[^cdc]

The most common household cleaners that are effective are listed below. Pay care to allow the cleaner to sit on the surface for the specified amount of time before wiping it off. If you don't let the cleaner sit long enough, you risk spreading the virus from one surface to another when you wipe it off.
 
| Cleaner | Contact Time |
|-------|--------|
| Lysol Disinfectant Spray | 10 minutes |
| LysolÂ® Disinfecting Wipes | 10 minutes |
| Clorox Bleach (not "splashless bleach") | 10 minutes |
| Isopropyl alcohol (at least 70% strength) | 30 seconds |
| Hydrogen Peroxide (3%) | 1 minute |

If a surface is dirty clean it with soap and water first. Note that bleach exipires in one year, and hydrogen peroxide expires in 6mo after opening.
